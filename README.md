# Sky-Falling
About
I made a Sky Falling using only turtle library in python. The game starts by two falling pices red one and anothor colored one then multiple colored and red pieces will start falling, when the player takes the colored pieces his/her score will increase by 2 and when he/she takes the red pieces the score will decrease by 1, and while the score is updating the game will get faster and faster and the red pieces will appear more than the colored once.
